# Fanfies
Submission for TCO15 SF Regional Hackathon

## API
The APIs I got from wheel are
 - Google
 - Spotify (Couldn't use because it's not open to non-US subscribers)
 - Instgram (Never used)

It sucked and I gave up the idea of submitting as I had hoped to get any of Salesforce, Twitter, Twilio etc.  However, discovered Instagram API is really simple to use and decided to put this together in about 8 hours.

## What is Fanfies?

Fanfies is an app for sports fan to be able to click and share pictures at a sporting event. It uses Instagram API and Google Geocoding API to detect a fan's location and then show a stream of Instagram images shared by fans at that location.

## How to run?

It's a regular XCode project. Just open the XCode project file and you should be good to go!

## Example

Fanfies shows thousands of fans used Instagram at the recently concluded NBA finals. It allows fans at stadium to discover each other's photos, like and recommend it others! 

Go Warriors!!!
